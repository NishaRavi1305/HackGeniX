Project Requirement Document
Project Title: Conversational AI for Candidate-HR Interaction
Project Type: AI Chatbot Integration with Unity and MongoDB
Owner: Hackgenix Tech Private Limited
🔍 Project Objective
To develop a conversational AI system that simulates an interaction between a job candidate
and an HR executive. The system should be trained on predefined data and capable of
handling job-related queries, resume discussion, general HR questions, etc. It must be
integrated into a Unity-based application and submit logs/interactions to MongoDB.
📦 Project Deliverables
1. AI Model
o Trained NLP model using Hugging Face or OpenAI APIs or LLM-based
custom solution
o Must support natural conversational flow
o HR domain-specific question answering capability
o Should understand and respond appropriately to candidate queries
2. API Layer
o RESTful API to expose chatbot functionality
o Must be able to send/receive messages via Unity
o JSON structured responses for ease of integration
o Authentication layer for basic security
3. Unity Integration
o Unity front-end interface for chat
o Candidate inputs will be typed or voice-based (if feasible)
o API integration to get real-time responses from AI bot
o Clean UI/UX for chat simulation
4. Database Integration
o MongoDB setup to store:
§ User input
§ Bot responses
§ Session timestamps
§ Evaluation logs
o Proper schema design and collection structure must be shared
5. Documentation
o Source code with comments
o API Documentation
o Model training dataset (or process if dataset is confidential)
o MongoDB schema
o Setup guide and deployment steps
o Final project report (PDF/Word)
